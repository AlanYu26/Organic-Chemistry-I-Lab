# Organic-Chemistry-I-Lab
All the lab reports written for Organic Chemistry I Lab 309 at Rutgers University with Professor Leslie Jimenez 2019.
Includes Unknown Analysis given at the start to be found by the end of the semester.
NOTE: These lab reports are not completely finished as I printed them to fill in the blank spots with the mechanisms, diagrams, etc.
